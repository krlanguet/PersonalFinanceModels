# PersonalFinanceTools
Some simple tools by Ryan Zambrotta and Keith Languet for personal financial analysis. Used by https://github.com/krlanguet/P-T-Transport and https://github.com/krlanguet/LanguetFamilyFinancials to analyze Languet family finances.

## TODO
- [ ] Internal data representation, informed from online research
    - Research existing OOP classes available
- [ ] Import functions for consuming gathered data

## Goals
We aim to create models of our potential earnings, particularly so that Keith can determine how long he will have to work in industry in order to support his parents and brother.

### Directives
Since this project is targeted at analyzing two specific entities, the precise functions that I need will be determined by the questions that I am trying to answer about the business and family. The most important question to me right now is how much income can we expect the business to generate.

We can start by determining how it has performed in the last year.

## Tools
* We will create functions for importing data from Google sheets, in different formats.
* We will need to create functions to model the cash flow of both a small business and a household.

## Python dependecies
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. google-api-python-client
