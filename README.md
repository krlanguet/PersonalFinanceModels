# PersonalFinanceTools

## TODO
- [ ] Internal data representation, informed from online research

## Tools
* We will create functions for importing data from Google sheets, in different formats.
* We will need to create functions to model the cash flow of both a small business and a household.

## Python dependecies
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. google-api-python-client
